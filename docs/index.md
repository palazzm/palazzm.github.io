#Welcome

This site is where I will have quick access to a personal bio and links to other sites regarding my work as a developer.

##About

My name is Matthew Palazzetti, and I have been a Software Engineer / Game Developer since late 2014.  In that time I have worked on several games using the Unity engine for the Casino Gaming Industry with IGT.  I take pride in my ability to learn new things to solve the problems in front of me whether it be for a job or a personal project.

In my free time I like to dabble with several hobbies that help train my skills not only in my current profession, but in other areas of content creation, digital and physical.  Although it can get quite annoying, I do enjoy the challenge and problem solving my career and hobbies provide.  

One of the main hobbies I partake in is live streaming on Twitch, which I have been succesful with maintaing a small following (under 1000 followers) along with an accompaning YouTube channel that is slowly growing. Despite the small number of subscribers there, I tend to get a few hundred views a day due to a handful of decently popular videos.  

This channel is the backbone of many of the different skills I have learned from managing a stream, editing a video, or occassionally creating computer programs aimed at solving problems related to the content created. 

Unforunately, I will not mention the channel here or on any account associated with my personal identity due to privacy concerns.  I know of at least one personal friend that has had issues due to others finding out their information and it did not end well.
